# Dankest_dungeon
Python ASCII game by Erik Sandberg

Run game from a terminal window using 'python dankest_dungeon.py'.

Use Python 2.x or else print statements will fail.

Use MacOS if possible, last portion of the game is not Windows compatible :( Maybe I'll look into fixing this.

Thanks for playing!
